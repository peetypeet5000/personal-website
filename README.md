# Peter LaMontagne's Personal Website

This website was created to allow me to practice setting up a webserver from scratch, and serve as a home for all my current & future projects.

## Using

### Requirements
* Node.js installed on server
* Root privlages to run on port 80 and 443

### Starting

Once cloned, run `npm install` to install dependencies. After that, run normally with `npm start` or run `npm run dev` to run in nodemon. Both commands must be run with admin privilages.


## Project Details

* Uses Node.js as server backend
* Express is used as the framework
* Handlebars is used as the templating engine
* All pages are generated from templates


## Current Real-World Use

This website serves as my personal website, accessible at peterlamontagne.com. It is running on a Raspberry Pi 3b, on Raspbian.
