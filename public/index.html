		<h3>Get-to-know Questions:</h3>

		<ol>
			<li><strong>What is the most complex or interesting thing you've done with your current web development skills?</strong>
				<p>I have done a fair amount of work with <em>easy</em> website builders, such as Wix and Wordpress,
				which has helped to develop my web design skills and has introduced me to a lot of web concepts. Using these services, 
				I made a website for a golf course that was visited by tens of thousands of people and I also assisted my Mom in setting 
				up an online shop for her buisness. Because none of these required me to do any actual coding, this class will introduce me to a side
				of the web I have not seen as much.</p>
			</li>
			<li><strong>What do you hope to learn from this class?</strong>
				<p>I want to learn how to make a website that is not just a static, html & css driven site.
				I want to make something that has interactivity and server-side components. Most of this will involve
				learning JavaScript and whatever else we're leaning that allows for more interactivity. Building static webpages
				is useful, but for a website to be truly useful, it almost always requires it have some degree of interactivity.</p>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Have you signed up for our course Piazza forum?</strong>
				<p>Yes.</p>
			</li>
			<li><strong>What is your most interesting fact/experience?</strong>
				<p>I stalled out my friends truck (pictured below) because I don't know how to drive a manual.</p>
